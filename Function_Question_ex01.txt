You are asked to write a C program to calculate the final mark and grade of 5 students for a subject. 

a) Write a function called calcFinalMark() to calculate the final mark of the subject. When 
calculating the final mark, 30% is taken from the assignment mark and 70% is taken from 
the paper mark. Function should return the final mark. Assignment mark and paper mark 
are given as parameters to the functions.

float calcFinalMark(float assignmentMark, float paperMark);

b) Write a function called findGrades() to return the grade obtained for the given final mark. 

Grades are calculated as follows:
char findGrades(float finalMark);

Final mark Grade
Mark >= 75 A
60 <= Mark < 75 B
50 <= Mark <60 C
Mark <50 F

c) Write a function called printDetails() to print the name, final mark and the grade of a 
student.

Your output should be as follows:

   Name     FinalMark    Grade

-------- -------------- --------
